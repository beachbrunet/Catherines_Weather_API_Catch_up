## Requirements

<!-- ----------------------- -->

```
If you choose to accept your mission....

Use the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data for cities. Read through the documentation for setup and usage instructions. You will use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.


GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
